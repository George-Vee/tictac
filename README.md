# VEE Embed

Single-div drop-in for sidebar + mobile bar, hero, rows, promo grid, and Zendesk bridge.

## Files
- `index.html` – example integration using external assets
- `assets/vee-embed.min.css` – styles
- `assets/vee-embed.min.js` – behavior
- `assets/vee-zd-hide.css` – hides the Zendesk launcher bubble only
- `assets/vee-zendesk-bridge.min.js` – opens Zendesk on your Chat button and offsets the widget on mobile

## Usage
1. Host the `assets/` folder and `index.html` on your site (or copy the HTML block into your CMS).
2. Keep your content inside `#veeEmbed` unchanged. Update image URLs and links as needed.
3. Font Awesome is loaded automatically if not already present on the page.
4. Countdown targets Friday 20:00 local time and auto-rolls weekly.
